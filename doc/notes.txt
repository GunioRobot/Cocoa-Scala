Dynamic Method Resolution:
    http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtDynamicResolution.html
    +(BOOL)resolveInstanceMethod:(SEL)aSEL
    +(BOOL)instancesRespondToSelector:(SEL)aSelector
     If respondsToSelector: or instancesRespondToSelector: is invoked, the dynamic method resolver is given the opportunity to provide an IMP for the selector first. If you implement resolveInstanceMethod: but want particular selectors to actually be forwarded via the forwarding mechanism, you return NO for those selectors.
