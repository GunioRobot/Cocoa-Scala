Cocoa+Scala

The goal of this project is to make it possible to develop Cocoa applications
in the Scala language, in a way that feels natural and seamless.

This project is still in the prototyping stage, so there is nothing yet
available to use.  In fact, everything here is subject to change, radically,
if the current design direction is deemed insufficient.

I am currently working towards the following first major milestone:

* Be able to build a very simple Cocoa+Scala application, where the 
application source is written entirely in Scala, and which can get
a handle on Objective-C classes and send messages to Objective-C
objects.  

* This milestone does not include the ability to extend Cocoa classes in
Scala (that will be milestone 2).  

* In this milestone, all interaction with Objective-C classes will be weakly
typed.  In a future milestone, the ability to write strongly typed expressions
will be supported.

The Scala code in milestone 1 might look something like the following:
    // get the NSBundle class
    val NSBundle = ObjcClass("NSBundle")
    // send the mainBundle selector
    val mainBundle = NSBundle!('mainBundle)
    // get jar files
    val imageResources = mainBundle!('pathsForResourcesOfType->"jar", 'inDirectory->"Java")
    ...
